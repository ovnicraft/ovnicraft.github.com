If you're looking for further reading I'd highly recommend checking out the book `PostgreSQL 9.0 High Performance <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/184951030X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=mypred-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=184951030X>`_. Greg Smith, the author, is a personal friend and knows Postgres Performance extremely well, there's not a more definitive reference for postgres performance.
